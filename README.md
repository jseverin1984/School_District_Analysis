# School District Analysis

## Overview

For this school district analysis, I was tasked with aggregating and analyzing the standardized testing scores of all students from a specific
school district. The overall goal was to aggregate, analyze, prepare, and showcase the data in order to identify any trends in school performace.
Providing a full analytical breakdown of the data will help those in charge of district make the best informed decisions possible when it comes 
to allocating resources and priorites when moving forward into the new school year.

## Results

After finishing the analysis, I was informed that testing scores from the 9th grade students at Thomas High School might have been falsified
in some form or fashion. In order to better reflect all of the true data for the disctrict, I removed all Thomas 9th grade test scores and reiterated
through all the data that would be affected by those false scores and updated the reports accordingly. Below is some of the information I found
and how it was affected.

- How is the district summary affected?

	Overall, the district summary was the least affected of the data. Since the sample size was every student in the district, removing the subset
	data of 9th graders from Thomas High School only affected the outcomes by one tenth of a percentage point.  Removing 461 scores from the
	roughly 39,000 students did not affect the data significantly.

- How is the school summary affected?

- How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores afect the following:

	1. Math and reading scores by grade

	2. Scores by school spending

	3. Scores by school size

	4. Scores  by school type
